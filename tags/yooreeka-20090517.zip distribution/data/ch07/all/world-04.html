 Sudan Names New Darfur Investigator, Further Denying The Hague

 <P>THE HAGUE, Netherlands&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;</P>State radio says Sudan has appointed a new prosecutor to investigate crimes in Darfur.<P></P>
<P>The move appears aimed at showing Sudan can use its own courts to prosecute war crimes in its troubled western region, where up to 300,000 people have died since 2003.</P>
<P>The government says it doesn&apos;t recognize the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor last month charged President Omar al-Bashir with genocide and other crimes against humanity.</P>
<P>Tuesday&apos;s report says the new prosecutor, Nimr Ibrahim Mohamed, will represent the state in courts and issue monthly reports to the government.</P>
<P>Human rights groups say Sudan&apos;s legal system is not equipped for trials of genocide or war crimes. It has previously prosecuted only few people, handing down light sentences.</P>
