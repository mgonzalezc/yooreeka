 Guus Hiddink pays tribute to his team&apos;s performance

 Russia boss Guus Hiddink paid tribute to his side&apos;s overall strength after their 3-1 Euro 2008 quarter-final extra time win over Netherlands.
 </B>
 <P></P>
&quot;I don&apos;t want to use big words but it is almost a miracle,&quot; said Hiddink after knocking out his home nation.
 <P></P>
&quot;I&apos;m so proud of these guys. Physically, technically and tactically we outplayed the Dutch and it is a huge achievement for us.
 <P></P>
&quot;It&apos;s amazing to see how fast they react to the technical concept.&quot;
 <P></P>
Roman Pavlyuchenko put Russia ahead only for Ruud van Nistelrooy to level late on to take the game into extra time.
 <P></P>
But Dmitri Torbinski and Andrei Arshavin secured the win for Hiddink&apos;s side.

 <P></P>
Arshavin put in an impressive and influential match-winning performance and, while Hiddink praised his star man, he also praised the Russia team.
 <P></P>
&quot;Arshavin did very well but needs the assistance of the others,&quot; he said. &quot;But he did a big job.
 <P></P>
&quot;He has tremendous skills. He knows how to dribble at a defence. Defenders can run with him but they cannot really attack him. It is what nature gave him.&quot;
 <P></P>
Netherlands were a shadow of the side that won each of their three group games, including wins over France and Italy.
 <P></P>
And Hiddink added: &quot;The Dutch were just dangerous at set pieces and it was a blow to concede the equaliser, but more of an achievement to win after conceding this goal.
 <P></P>
&quot;In extra time I told the players to go forward and look for a goal as they were as tired as we were. I also told them to have mental strength and they responded perfectly.
 <P></P>
&quot;We did not talk a lot about it in the preview of the game but we had just two days to recover and prepare after a tough Sweden match.&quot;
 <P></P>
