Tell Us What You Think About Cell Phones&apos; Link to Cancer

</P><P>
Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, told his own faculty to limit their time on cell phones because of a possible risk of brain cancer.
</P><P>
His warning pointed to nonpublished research, which suggests that everyone, but especially children, should limit &quot;long-term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer.&quot;
</P><P>
Children are particularly at risk because their brains are still developing, Herberman said.
</P><P>
The American Cancer Society said that Herberman&apos;s warning was too strong, given the lack of scientific evidence, and that if there is a risk, it is very small. </P><P>
</P><P>
Herberman said that even a small risk is too great for ourselves and especially our children.
</P><P>
