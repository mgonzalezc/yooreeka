        Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon says the club have agreed to sell Robinho to Manchester City.

Chelsea have been chasing the Brazilian forward's signature but City are set to capture him for a British record fee believed to be Â£32.5m.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"We have agreed to sell the player for human reasons, and for footballing reasons and for an important quantity of money," Calderon told Spanish TV.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"After consulting with the technical staff we have decided it was the best."
