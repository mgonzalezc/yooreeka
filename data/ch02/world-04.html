    MANAGUA: Daniel Ortega, who fought the American-backed contras in a bloody war in the 1980s, 
    held a strong lead over four other Nicaraguan presidential candidates in preliminary results 
    here, officials said early Monday.
    </p> 
	<p>
	With 15 percent of polling stations reporting, Ortega had 40 percent, versus 33 percent 
	for his Harvard-educated rival Eduardo Montealegre of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance.
	</p> 
	<p>
	Trailing behind were a Sandinista dissident Edmundo Jarqu&#237;n; the governing party's 
	candidate, Jose Rizo; and a former contra rebel, Eden Pastora.
	</p> 
	<p>
	If Ortega, a former Marxist revolutionary, does not squeeze out a first- round victory 
	and is forced into a runoff next month, analysts expect him to lose, because the country's 
	strong anti-Ortega opposition would unite against him.
