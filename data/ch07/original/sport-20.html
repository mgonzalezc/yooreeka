        Russia boss Guus Hiddink paid tribute to his side's overall strength after their 3-1 Euro 2008 quarter-final extra time win over Netherlands.
      
    
      
        </b>
      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"I don't want to use big words but it is almost a miracle," said Hiddink after knocking out his home nation. 

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"I'm so proud of these guys. Physically, technically and tactically we outplayed the Dutch and it is a huge achievement for us. 

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"It's amazing to see how fast they react to the technical concept."

      
    
    
  

  
    
      
      <div class="bo">
    
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Roman Pavlyuchenko put Russia ahead only for Ruud van Nistelrooy to level late on to take the game into extra time. 

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
But Dmitri Torbinski and Andrei Arshavin secured the win for Hiddink's side.

Arshavin put in an impressive and influential match-winning performance and, while Hiddink praised his star man, he also praised the Russia team. 

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"Arshavin did very well but needs the assistance of the others," he said. "But he did a big job. 

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"He has tremendous skills. He knows how to dribble at a defence. Defenders can run with him but they cannot really attack him. It is what nature gave him." 

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Netherlands were a shadow of the side that won each of their three group games, including wins over France and Italy. 

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
And Hiddink added: "The Dutch were just dangerous at set pieces and it was a blow to concede the equaliser, but more of an achievement to win after conceding this goal. 

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"In extra time I told the players to go forward and look for a goal as they were as tired as we were. I also told them to have mental strength and they responded perfectly. 

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"We did not talk a lot about it in the preview of the game but we had just two days to recover and prepare after a tough Sweden match."
