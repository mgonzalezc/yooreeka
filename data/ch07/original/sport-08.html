        Michael Phelps won his eighth Olympic gold medal of the Beijing Games to beat Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven, with victory in the 4x100m medley.

        <p />
      
    
      
        
The 23-year-old teamed up with Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen and Jason Lezak to claim the historic gold for the United States in a world record time.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
They held off Australia and Japan to win in three minutes 29.34 seconds.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Britain finished in sixth, but the race was all about record-breaking Phelps' place in history.

Victory in the 4x100m relay rounded off a remarkable Olympics the 6ft 4in swimmer, who has dominated the action in the Water Cube.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
However, his final triumph was far from straightforward.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Phelps dived into the water for the third leg butterfly with his team in third position but he powered them into the lead.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Australian Eamon Sullivan tried to chase the Americans down but Lezak held on to clinch Phelps' record win.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
It also took Phelps' Olympic medal haul to 14 golds, and 16 overall.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
Phelps admitted to being overwhelmed after achieving his feat, and was quick to pay tribute to his team-mates.

        <p />
      
    
      
        
"There are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement. I kind of just want to see my mom.

"Without the help of my team-mates this isn't possible.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"I was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"For the three Olympics I've been a part of, this is by far the closest men's team that we've ever had.

      
    
      
        <p />
      
    
      
        
"I didn't know everybody coming into this Olympics, but I feel going out I know every single person very well. The team that we had is the difference.
