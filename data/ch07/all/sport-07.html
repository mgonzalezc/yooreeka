 Cyclist first to fail drugs test
 <P></P>
 <B>
 Spanish cyclist Maria Isabel Moreno has become the first athlete to fail a drugs test at the Beijing Olympics.
 </B>
 <P></P>
 Moreno, who was entered for the women&apos;s road race and individual time trial, tested positive for the endurance-boosting drug EPO.
 <P></P>
 She could now face a two-year ban and, under a new International Olympic Committee rule, could also be banned from the 2012 London Olympics.
 <P></P>
 The IOC said it expected up to 40 positive drug tests during the Games.
 <P></P>
 The Spanish cyclist, also known as Maribel Moreno, was tested on 31 July and left the city before the Games began.
 <P></P>
 &quot;She was quite different after being tested,&quot; secretary general of the Spanish Cycling Federation Eugenio Bermudez said.
 <P></P>
 &quot;She was crying all the time and she insisted she wanted to go home.&quot;
 <P></P>
 Reports in Spain had earlier said the cyclist had pulled out after suffering an &quot;anxiety attack&quot;.
 <P></P>
 A statement on the cyclist&apos;s official website posted on Saturday said Moreno was in Spain recovering from &quot;a strong anxiety attack suffered in the athletes&apos; village&quot;.

 &quot;Even though her state of health is good she does not feel ready to justify or explain her reasons for leaving the village,&quot; the statement said.
 <P></P>
 Spain&apos;s government insisted it would take the strongest action possible to eradicate the problem.
 <P></P>
 &quot;We are going to hunt down these shameless people who harm our athletes. We are going to clamp down totally and will take the toughest action,&quot; said Spain&apos;s sports minister Jaime Lissavetzky.
 <P></P>
 &quot;I ask you Maribel, looking you in the eyes, &apos;who gave you the substance and where did you buy it?&apos;
 <P></P>
 &quot;Anyone involved will get the maximum punishment. We will find out who supplied the substances and, if necessary, jail them.&quot;
 <P></P>
 The Spanish Olympic Committee (SOC) said it was unaware of the positive test until being informed on Monday.
 <P></P>
 &quot;This is a stain on Spanish sport,&quot; said SOC chief Alejandro Blanco said.
 <P></P>
 Seven Russian athletes were last week provisionally suspended by the IAAF for doping offences, but they had yet to arrive at the Games.
