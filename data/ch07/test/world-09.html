 Japan&apos;s Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda has announced his resignation during a news conference at his official residence.
 </B>
 <P></P>
The surprise announcement means the 72-year-old is resigning less than a year after he took office.
 <P></P>
His government has suffered chronic unpopularity. Lost pension records, a controversial healthcare scheme and a sliding economy have added to his woes.
 <P></P>
Mr Fukuda has also been frustrated by the upper house of parliament, which is controlled by the opposition.
 <P></P>
&quot;If we are to prioritise the people&apos;s livelihoods, there cannot be a political vacuum from political bargaining, or a lapse in policies,&quot; said Mr Fukuda.
 <P></P>
He told the hastily convened news conference that a new team was needed to implement his party&apos;s policies.

 Low ratings

 <P></P>
Mr Fukuda did not say when his resignation would take effect, adding that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party would hold an internal election to choose his successor.
 <P></P>
&quot;I believe there will be an election for the party leader,&quot; he said. &quot;The leader will be appointed as the prime minister.&quot;
 <P></P>
 <P></P>
Japan&apos;s next general election must be held no later than September 2009.
 <P></P>
Last month, Mr Fukuda instigated a major cabinet reshuffle in which one of his main political rivals, Taro Aso, assumed the key role of secretary general.
 <P></P>
The move was seen as a last-ditch attempt to shore up Mr Fukuda&apos;s government and boost its flagging popularity, but it failed to impact low cabinet approval ratings, which had been below 30% for several months.
 <P></P>
Mr Aso, 67, went from being foreign minister to becoming party secretary general under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in August 2007.
 <P></P>
However, following Mr Abe&apos;s resignation, he left the post and lost the LDP leadership contest to Mr Fukuda soon afterwards.
 <P></P>
Known for his conservative views, he has advocated a tough line towards North Korea and rejects changing the law to allow women to ascend the throne.
 <P></P>
He is also seen as a charismatic figure who is known to love Japanese manga cartoons.
