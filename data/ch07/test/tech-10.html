The 18-year-old high school student is accused of stabbing the cab driver to death by trying to copy a scene from the game.

Thai newspapers say the teenager, whose name has been withheld, was arrested while trying to steer a cab backwards out of a Bangkok street with the driver still in the back seat.
 <P></P>
Police claim the 18-year-old confessed to stealing the taxi and said he killed the 54-year-old driver after he fought back. The teenager could face the death penalty if he is found guilty.
 <P></P>
Bangkok police Captain Veerarit Pipatanasak said: &quot;He wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game.

&quot;He wanted money to play the game. His parents, who work as civil servants, did not have enough money to give him.&quot;
 <P></P>
Thailand&apos;s Culture Ministry has recently been pushing for tougher regulation of games like Grand Theft Auto.
 <P></P>
It wants stricter age ratings and restrictions on the hours that people can play games in arcades.
 <P></P>
Ladda Thangsupachai, director of the ministry&apos;s Cultural Surveillance Centre, said: &quot;This time-bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse. Today it is a cab driver, but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner.&quot;
