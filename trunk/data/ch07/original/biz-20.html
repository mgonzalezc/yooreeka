      <p>     Aug. 20 (Bloomberg) -- <a href="/apps/quote?ticker=CMCSA%3AUS" onmouseover="return escape( popwQuoteShort( this, 'CMCSA:US' ))">Comcast Corp.</a> plans to slow Internet
service to its heaviest users during periods of congestion,
after regulators ordered the company to devise a new method for
managing its Web traffic.     </p>
       <p>The top Internet speeds for targeted customers will be
reduced for periods lasting 10 minutes to 20 minutes, keeping
service to other users flowing, Mitch Bowling, Comcast&#39;s senior
vice president and general manager of online services, said in
an interview yesterday.     </p>
       <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission found on Aug. 1
that Comcast had improperly blocked peer-to-peer programs such
as BitTorrent that are used to share videos and other files. In
an order posted on its <a href="http://www.fcc.gov" target="_blank" onmouseover="return escape( popwOpenWebSite( this ))">Web site</a> today, the FCC gave the
Philadelphia-based company 30 days to provide details of its
``unreasonable network management practices&#39;&#39; and show how they
would be changed by year-end.     </p>
       <p>``We&#39;re going to really have to see all the detail and have
all the information,&#39;&#39; Marvin Ammori, general counsel for the
non-profit group Free Press, said in an interview. Free Press,
which promotes universal access to communications, and another
organization, Public Knowledge, filed the complaint that
resulted in the FCC censure.     </p>
       <p>The new system will move away from a focus on specific
applications that hog Web traffic, Bowling said. Comcast will
determine ``in nearly real time&#39;&#39; whether congestion is caused
by a heavy user, he said.     </p>
       <p>``If in fact a person is generating enough packets that
they&#39;re the ones creating that situation, we will manage that
consumer for the overall good of all of our consumers,&#39;&#39; Bowling
said.     </p>
       <p>Managing Traffic     </p>
       <p>Comcast, which reported 14.4 million Internet users at the
end of the <a href="/apps/quote?ticker=CMCSA%3AUS" onmouseover="return escape( popwQuoteShort( this, 'CMCSA:US' ))">second quarter</a>, fell 21 cents to $21.28 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained
17 percent this year.     </p>
       <p>Free Press and Public Knowledge, both based in Washington,
told the FCC in a Nov. 1 complaint that Comcast ``is secretly
degrading innovative protocols used for transporting and sharing
large files, like high-quality television programming and
movies.&#39;&#39;     </p>
       <p>The FCC acted ``to protect consumers&#39; access to the
Internet,&#39;&#39; FCC Chairman <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Kevin+Martin&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1" onmouseover="return escape( popwSearchNews( this ))">Kevin Martin</a> said in an Aug. 1
interview.     </p>
       <p>Comcast has decided to use the new system, which it calls
``fair share,&#39;&#39; and will fine-tune it further before introducing
it, Bowling said.     </p>
       <p>Pricing Decision     </p>
       <p>The company is considering whether to charge subscribers
more for heavier Internet use, a step announced by some other
cable companies, Bowling said. <a href="/apps/quote?ticker=TWC%3AUS" onmouseover="return escape( popwQuoteShort( this, 'TWC:US' ))">Time Warner Cable Inc.,</a> the
second-largest U.S. cable company, started testing metered
pricing in Beaumont, Texas.     </p>
       <p>``I think everyone&#39;s looked at something,&#39;&#39; Bowling said.
``We haven&#39;t made any decisions.&#39;&#39;     </p>
       <p>In trials, Comcast has found the fair share system to be
effective if the slowing lasts for ``roughly between, probably,
10 and 20 minutes,&#39;&#39; Bowling said. The user&#39;s Internet speed
would then return to normal.     </p>
       <p>``If they continue that, we would have to manage them
again,&#39;&#39; Bowling said.     </p>
       <p>A user being impeded would have Internet speeds equivalent
to ``a really good DSL experience,&#39;&#39; Bowling said. DSL, or
digital subscriber line, is an Internet service offered by
telephone companies.     </p>
