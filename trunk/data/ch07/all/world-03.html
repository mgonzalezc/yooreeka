Range of Russian Mourners Pay Tribute to Solzhenitsyn
By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ
 <P>MOSCOW  Scientists and clergy, dissidents and government officials  Russian and Soviet  came together Tuesday to bid farewell to <A href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/aleksandr_solzhenitsyn/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</A>, the Russian literary master who died Sunday evening. </P>
<P> Mr. Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s prose sliced into the propaganda of the Soviet Union, helping to alter the consciousness of a whole generation. For this, many braved driving rains for a chance to pay their respects at the Russian Academy of Sciences, where his body lay. </P>
<P>&ldquo;During perestroika, when &lsquo;The Gulag Archipelago&rsquo; became accessible, it changed my world view,&rdquo; Anatoly Anizov, a 52-year-old economist, said, referring to Mr. Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s monumental book about the Soviet prison system. </P>
<P>&ldquo;After I read it, the history of the U.S.S.R. was cast in a new light,&rdquo; he said, adding that he realized that &ldquo;70 years of Soviet government was a mistake.&rdquo; </P>
<P>Mr. Solzhenitsyn, who was 89 and died of heart failure, will be buried Wednesday at the Donskoy Monastery in Moscow after a service at the cathedral there. </P>
<P>Flanked by his wife, Natalia, and their sons and covered by flowers, Mr. Solzhenitsyn, a <A href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/nobel_prizes/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Nobel Prize</A> winner, lay in an open coffin as mourners filed into a hall in the academy of sciences, some lingering to pray. </P>
<P>Though perhaps hundreds paid their respects throughout the day, including Prime Minister <A href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/vladimir_v_putin/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Vladimir V. Putin</A> and <A href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/mikhail_s_gorbachev/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Mikhail S. Gorbachev</A>, the former Soviet leader, little evidence of nationwide mourning has been seen. That suggests that the prominence of Mr. Solzhenitsyn, considered one of the greatest 20th-century writers, is waning in his native country. </P>
<P>Mr. Putin on Tuesday urged <A href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/russiaandtheformersovietunion/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">Russia</A>&rsquo;s education minister to include more of Mr. Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s works in school curriculums. </P>
<P>&ldquo;He gave society a significant inoculation against tyranny in any of its guises,&rdquo; Mr. Putin told the minister. </P>
<P>&ldquo;I know there is a certain amount of his works in school curriculums,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I do not think there is enough.&rdquo; </P>
