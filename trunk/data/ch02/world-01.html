   The Sandinista leader, Daniel Ortega, today looked increasingly likely to be returned 
   to power, 16 years after a US-backed rebellion helped to oust him from office.
   <P>
   Preliminary results after 15% of ballots had been counted following yesterday's elections 
   in Nicaragua showed the former president had polled 40% of the vote, in what could be one 
   of Latin America's biggest political comebacks.
   <P>
   Early figures indicated he had opened up a lead of 7% over his Harvard-educated rival, 
   Eduardo Montealegre of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance.
   <P>
   Mr Ortega needs to gain 40% of the vote, or 35% and an advantage of 5% over his closest rival, 
   to avoid a runoff next month.
   <P>
   Trailing behind were the Sandinista dissident Edmundo Jarqu&iacute;n, the ruling-party 
   candidate, Jos&eacute; Rizo, and the former Contra rebel Ed&eacute;n Pastora.
   <P>
   The race is Mr Ortega's fifth consecutive presidential campaign. The former Marxist and 
   Soviet sympathiser won a 1984 election that was boycotted by Sandinista opponents and 
   condemned as unfair by the then US president, Ronald Reagan.
   <P>
   Mr Ortega then lost in 1990 to Violeta Chamorro, who headed a multiparty alliance drawn 
   from opposite ends of the political spectrum. Mr Ortega's popularity was damaged by the 
   US-backed Contra guerrilla movement, which was accused of waging of a brutal campaign of 
   intimidation. His next two presidential attempts, in 1996 and 2001, were also failures.
   <P>
   Mr Ortega's victory, if confirmed by final results, would give the Venezuelan president, 
   Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, a strong ally in the region. Mr Ch&aacute;vez has already offered 
   cheap oil if Mr Ortega wins. The Bush administration has threatened to cut aid to Nicaragua, 
   one of the world's poorest countries, if Mr Ortega is returned to power.
   <P>
   The US embassy issued a statement late last night saying it was too soon to "make an 
   overall judgment on the fairness and transparency of the process".<P>Mr Ortega's supporters 
   flooded the streets, setting off celebratory fireworks, waving the party's red-and-black flag 
   and swaying to the candidate's campaign song, which is set to the tune of John Lennon's Give 
   Peace a Chance.
   <P>
   Mr Montealegre, whose party broke from the ruling Constitutionalist Liberal party after 
   the former president Arnoldo Alem&aacute;n was convicted of corruption, brushed aside 
   Mr Ortega's lead, saying: "No one has won here. The Nicaraguan people, in a runoff, 
   will determine the next president."<P>Analysts have said Mr Ortega stands less chance 
   of winning a runoff as various opponents are likely to unite behind a single candidate.
   <P>
   Mr Ortega has received support from thousands of emigrants who returned to vote. 
   Many still have bitter memories of the Sandinistas' decade in power, though Mr Ortega 
   has repeatedly said he has changed, recasting himself as a reconciler. His vice-presidential 
   candidate, Jaime Morales, was once one of his biggest enemies, serving as the spokesman 
   for the Contras.
   <P>
   At stake is millions of dollars in potential investment, much of it from foreign companies 
   drawn to Nicaragua by the country's cheap labour, low crime rates and decision to join the 
   new Central American Free Trade Agreement. Many are waiting to see if Mr Ortega wins and 
   stays true to promises to continue free-trade policies.
